shard program search — SEARCH.md
=================================

STATUS: RATIFIED (user review 2026-07-11) — the scope ledger for the
meta-search arc: a lasting, in-repo replication of the search
playground's basic behaviors, built under meta/ against the real
kernel, the real canonical dialect, and the real proof machinery.
User rulings on record: the durable-home identity (§1), the
clone-first graduation methodology (§4), the performance posture
(D7), D1 = reserved-head Call encoding, D2 = meta/sketch in meta/
from day one. D3–D5 and D8 stand as written (ratified defaults);
per-slice check-ins with the user per house norm. Development lives
in the shard.search worktree (branch search-arc, cut 2026-07-11);
this file is the scope authority.

The evidence base is ~/workspace/playground/shard_search_playground
(read as data, never touched). Its README is the measurement record:
needed narrowing over shard terms, lemma-quotiented grammars,
law-directed verdicts, the canonical-program catalog, and the mined
canon rules that CANON.md §13 turned into C11/C12. Numbers cited
below are from that README.


## 1. Why a lasting version: the durable home

The playground proved five things (its "Lessons for shard" section):
superposition is an executor strategy, sketches are meta-layer work,
the generator/recognizer duality earns its keep, canonicalization is
the whole cost of search, and the memo is the whole game.

The lasting version is built in shard because shard is where anything
we intend to DEPEND on lives (USER RULING 2026-07-11). Two facts
retire the speed anxiety up front:

- **The constant factor is a closing gap, not a given.** shard's
  performance gap with C/Rust is an active target, and closing it
  ENTIRELY is a success criterion for the language itself. A search
  engine written in shard rides that trajectory (a flagship consumer
  for the lowering arc), rather than hedging against it.
- **The domain's swings dwarf the constant factor anyway.** Measured
  across every playground arc: a demo either settles in under a
  second or is intractable, and which of the two it is is decided by
  the quotient/oracle match (the two-curve gap), never by evaluator
  throughput. A 100x hosting factor turns 0.5s into 50s and turns
  intractable into intractable; it does not move the boundary.

What the playground structurally CANNOT do is couple. It re-implements
an approximation of the dialect (its own canon flags), remaps
requirements by hand, deliberately stopped short of the proof finish
line ("rendering each Proven region's trace as a shard proof term …
deliberately not built yet"), and its counts ride machine words that
overflow. Every one of those gaps is a thing this repo already owns:

- **The real dialect.** kernel/canon.shard's recognizers (C1–C11) and
  tools/canon's fixpoint are the ground truth the playground's
  `canon`/`dialect` flags approximate. A generated candidate can be
  GATED canonical — generate, then assert `cn_e` returns Nil — instead
  of hoped canonical.
- **The real requirements.** mod.req.shard surfaces parse natively;
  the laws oracle needs no remapping hacks.
- **The real proof machinery.** tools/prove's sidecar format, merge
  discipline, and bin/shard_check replay exist. The playground's
  missing finish line — Proven verdicts becoming zero-trust
  certificates — is REACHABLE here, and it is the single biggest
  reason to build in-repo at all.
- **Exact counting.** Int is bignum; the playground's u64→u128→panic
  ladder dissolves. Counts are exact at any rung, with no guard code.
- **The census flywheel.** The README's closing cycle — census →
  classify residue → name the rule and license → implement at the
  priced tier → re-measure with behaviors preserved — is the loop
  that produced C11. Running it against the REAL dialect, with
  kernel-certified equivalence brackets, is CANON.md's measurement
  instrument from §13 onward.

So the arc's identity: **the durable home for program search —
kernel-coupled, proof-finished — whose primary deliverable is the
meta/ vocabulary for navigating the space of shard code.** The
playground stays what it is: the throwaway exploration lab whose
findings graduate here.


## 2. What the repo already owns (the mapping)

| playground piece | in-repo owner |
|---|---|
| eval.rs (ground CBV evaluator) | kernel/evm.shard via meta/invoke's `evm_call_pure` — already the plan-step engine |
| canon flags / dialect grammar | kernel/canon.shard recognizers + tools/canon fixpoint (the ground truth) |
| four append lemmas, lia normalizer, ring rules | std/list, std/arith, kernel/facts — proven, typed, citable |
| law parsing (mod.req remap) | the module system's own req surfaces |
| proof finish line (absent) | tools/prove sidecars + bin/shard_check replay |
| u64/u128 counting | native bignum Int |
| SplitMix64 sampling | std/rng (or a sibling PRNG added under the same discipline) |
| recognizer side of the duality | meta/shape precedent (recognizers as a meta library; §6ae line) |
| behavior fingerprints (128-bit digests) | std/sha256 (hx_digest precedent) |

The pieces with NO in-repo owner — the sketch vocabulary, the
generators, the engines, the symbolic evaluator — are the arc.


## 3. The subsystem ledger

Each subsystem gets: what it buys, what it costs to maintain
(coupling), and a proposed verdict.

**S1. meta/sketch — the term-with-holes vocabulary.**
Sketch representation, per-hole grammar tables (alternative lists),
exact candidate counting, rank/unrank (the space is rank-addressable,
so sampling and slicing are free), fill/render, hole sharing (one
HoleId at two positions = same subtree, the correlation primitive).
*Buys:* the foundation every other subsystem consumes; lesson 2
verbatim ("a meta/ sketch vocabulary … is all shard needs").
*Costs:* pure data + arithmetic; near-zero coupling.
*Verdict:* **BUILD, first.**

**S2. Dialect grammar builders — the generator side of the duality.**
Grammar constructors that speak the canonical dialect as generation
constraints: C4 arm order, C5 exhaustiveness/no-dead-arms, decided
control excluded (C2/C11's generator image = the pinned normal form),
theory quotients where the lemma set is proven (append operand
constraints; ring spines later). Gated, not trusted: G1/G2 below.
*Buys:* lesson 3 — every recognizer run backwards; searchable spaces
at all; the measurement instrument that prices every future C-rule
(each new rule's generation-side payoff becomes a number).
*Costs:* the REAL maintenance item of the arc — a third speaker of
the canon rules (kernel recognizer, tools/canon fixer, generator).
Drift between speakers is the failure mode; the census gates are the
alarm. This coupling is also the point: it is CANON.md's flywheel.
*Verdict:* **BUILD**, with the gates as a non-negotiable part of the
subsystem, not an afterthought.

**S3. Ground engine — enumerate/unrank + evaluate.**
Candidates run against I/O batteries through the real evaluator
(evm_call_pure on the filled, closed term). Early-exit across tests,
absence proofs by exhaustion at small depth, the cross-check for
everything cleverer.
*Buys:* the baseline oracle; exactness for free; tiny.
*Costs:* near-zero (rides kernel/evm).
*Verdict:* **BUILD, first** (with S1).

**S4a. Symbolic evaluator — per-candidate three-valued verdicts.**
Symbolic values for ∀-binders, case splits allocating one shape per
ctor (symbolic ADTs over the type table), canonical neutrals (fn- and
prim-headed; join by same-head-equal-args congruence), verdicts
Proven / Refuted / Undecided with a split budget, and the two IH
licenses (D5). NOTE the decomposition this ledger makes that the
playground did not: the playground built its laws mode ON the
superposed candidate engine, but per-candidate symbolic evaluation
does not need candidate superposition — one term, one goal, case-split
regions only. That is a far smaller machine, and it is the one the
catalog and the proof finish line actually need.
*Buys:* the laws oracle (S5), catalog refinement (S7), and the input
to proof rendering (S6). One symbolic case refutes what ground
testing kills one value at a time.
*Costs:* the largest NEW engineering item that is not deferrable; no
existing shard code does this. Kinship with tools/prove is real (the
same case-split + steps + refl shape; its unhinted case-on discovery
already scans stuck frontiers) — shared machinery graduates to meta/
only when both speak it, per the hygiene-pass ruling; do not force
premature unification.
*Verdict:* **BUILD**, as its own slice, after S1–S3 prove the
plumbing.

**S4b. Superposed candidate executor — needed narrowing proper.**
The choices-map machine: shared thunk graph, consulted-choice-set
memo, fork on demanded holes, prefix kills, don't-cares.
*Buys:* essentially every fast settlement in the playground is a
narrowing result — enumeration is the engine that dies (1,181× at
rev d3; the only reason 10^15+ spaces settle at all). This is the
core engine of the "basic search behaviors" being replicated.
*Costs:* the largest single machine in the arc. The memo is
mutable-arena-shaped in Rust, and a pure-functional rendering
(structural keys, the two-level consulted-set index) is a real
engineering item — an item to engineer, not a reason to doubt the
tier (D6/D7).
*Verdict:* **BUILD, late in the ladder** — sequenced after
S1–S3/S4a because those rungs are its parts bin (vocabulary,
grammars, the evaluation substrate, neutrals), not because its value
or its hosting is in question. No performance go/no-go.

**S5. Laws oracle — requirements as the search oracle.**
Parse a requirement, bind its ∀-binders symbolically, remap the
subject fn to the sketch, compare goal sides under S4a. Rule sets for
canonical neutrals drawn ONLY from proven, typed equations (D4).
*Buys:* proofs instead of tests; the impostor problem (six
under-constraining examples "solving" sort) dissolves at the root.
*Costs:* thin over S4a + the module system.
*Verdict:* **BUILD** (same slice family as S4a).

**S6. Proof rendering — the finish line.**
A Proven verdict's trace becomes shard proof text: case-on/induct,
steps of unfold / rewrite-lemma / refl, IH citations — emitted as a
generated .shard program (the synthesized fns + claims/fulfills) with
its .auto.shard sidecar, replayed through bin/shard_check. A Proven
that fails replay is a HARD failure (G4). The search's verdicts
become zero-trust certificates; the engines stay outside the trust
surface entirely, like the compiled chain.
*Buys:* the thing the playground deliberately lacks; the arc's
unique payoff. Search output = a shard program the kernel has
checked, not a claim about one.
*Costs:* moderate; rides tools/prove's sidecar format and the proof
DSL. The render layer is coupled to proof-form syntax (stable, and
already machine-written by tools/prove daily).
*Verdict:* **BUILD** — and treat it as the arc's exit criterion, not
an optional extra.

**S7. Catalog / census — the CANON.md flywheel.**
Enumerate a canonical rung, battery-bucket by behavior digest
(std/sha256 over rendered output vectors; two-level fingerprinting
per the census lesson — silence is not success), refine the bracket
with S4a equivalence proofs (floor rises on refuted pairs, ceiling
falls on proven ones), and — with S6 — CERTIFY the bracket at small
rungs the way the playground certified d1 (19 programs = exactly 13
functions). Sampling instruments (rank-addressable + std/rng) later.
*Buys:* the census loop that mined C11/C12, now running against the
real dialect with kernel-checked equivalences; spellings-per-behavior
against the REAL rule ledger is the metric CANON.md optimizes.
*Costs:* thin composition of S1/S2/S3/S4a; battery data is data.
*Verdict:* **BUILD** (enumerate+bucket early; refinement after S4a).

**S8. Tasks and batteries.**
The concrete sketches (rev, sort's insert, the calculator, …), their
I/O batteries, their requirement oracles. Data plus thin drivers in
the tool bin. The oracle lessons travel with them: batteries need the
input shapes that separate impostors ([2,1,3] for insert; deep-push-
then-add for the VM), and every task should state whether its oracle
is tests (floor only) or laws (certifiable).
*Verdict:* **BUILD** (small; grows by accretion).

**S9. Gates.**
- **G1 canonicality:** every generated candidate at pinned small
  depths passes kernel `cn_e` = Nil and is a tools/canon fixpoint.
  The three-speakers drift alarm.
- **G2 quotient exactness:** at d1–d2, the dialect grammar's candidate
  set equals the raw grammar's normal forms, censused term-by-term
  (the --canon-verify discipline); behaviors preserved within the
  one-rung depth price (the raw twin's measured law).
- **G3 cross-engine agreement:** law-Proven ⊆ ground-test passers; no
  passer Refuted; ground and symbolic partitions consistent wherever
  both run.
- **G4 kernel replay:** every Proven renders and replays green
  through bin/shard_check. Non-negotiable.
- **G5 pinned counts:** canonical-program counts and behavior-bucket
  counts at fixed rungs pinned in run_corpus.sh (the census-gate
  discipline). A canon-rule change moves them; intentional moves
  re-pin with the change, like tools/canon's census today.
*Verdict:* **BUILD**, incrementally with their subsystems.

**Explicitly OUT (not built, not maintained):**
the OE engine (the literature control lost the races; its lesson is
recorded), the damascene race UI, the vanity/IC comparison, wedge
parallelism (until a compiled engine exists to parallelize),
hashprune/opportunistic pruning (an S4b follow-on; enters scope only
with it), u128 counter machinery (bignum), and playground parity as
a goal — the playground keeps modes this version never grows.


## 4. Placement: clone first, graduate into meta/

The development vehicle (USER RULING 2026-07-11): **build a clone of
the program-search toy as a tool, and graduate pieces into meta/ as
clean buckets emerge** — the tools/low/shape → meta/shape history,
adopted this time as deliberate methodology rather than discovered
after the fact. The arc's primary durable deliverable is the meta/
vocabulary for navigating the space of shard code (terms with holes,
grammars, enumerate/count/rank, fingerprints, symbolic verdicts);
the search tool is the forcing function that mines that vocabulary
and the example that proves each bucket before it graduates.

- **tools/search** — the clone: tasks, batteries, census drivers,
  CLI, corpus-gate entry points, and the engines while they are
  still finding their shape.
- **meta/sketch** — the one candidate for day-one meta/ residence,
  with its reuse story stated up front: term-with-holes +
  enumerate/count/rank/fill is lesson 3's ask ("shipping
  enumerate/count beside each recognizer would make every
  certified-lowering shape a search dialect for free") and
  meta/shape's natural sibling. Confirmed at D2: day-one meta/.
- **meta/search** (or finer buckets) — populated by graduation, not
  up front. A piece moves when its bucket is clean and a second
  consumer exists or is concrete, per the hygiene-pass ruling.
- Proof rendering (S6) starts in the tool; anything tools/prove
  later also speaks graduates the same way.

Trust posture, stated once: **the engines are never the soundness
authority.** Ground/symbolic agreement is a gate; the kernel replay
of rendered proofs is the only certificate; everything else is a
differentially-gated accelerator, exactly the compiled-chain regime.


## 5. Decision points

**D1 — hole representation (RESOLVED 2026-07-11 — ruling a).** A
reserved-head encoding inside kernel Expr —
`(Call (:: meta sketch hole) (IntLit k))` — so every existing Expr
walker, recognizer, and renderer works on partial terms unchanged,
with loud classifier helpers in meta/sketch; the kernel never checks
a sketch (holes are filled before any check). Rejected: (b) a
parallel SketchExpr type (duplicates every walker, cuts sketches off
from the real recognizers); (c) holes as reserved FVars (a numbered
hole id rides better as an IntLit argument).

**D2 — placement and graduation (RESOLVED 2026-07-11).** §4's
clone-first methodology stands, AND meta/sketch starts in meta/ from
day one on its stated reuse story. Trust tier: no engine output is
ever load-bearing without G4.

**D3 — evaluation substrate.** Ground evaluation via kernel/evm
(`evm_call_pure`, the meta/invoke precedent) — single hosted
interpretation, no engine-private evaluator to keep in agreement.
The symbolic evaluator (S4a) is necessarily new code; it shares the
term vocabulary but not the machine.

**D4 — oracle rule sets.** Canonical-neutral rewrites are drawn ONLY
from proven requirements, carrying their binder types as side
conditions (the append_nil_right lesson, learned three separate
times: an escaping operand needs its type known; spine-rebuilding
rewrites are fail-consistent). First cut: the append four + the lia
normalizer under std/arith's stated license. Ring rules (CANON.md
D9's predicted set) when a task demands them. Three certificate
categories, all kernel-replayable: definitional, lemma-cited,
decision-procedure-backed.

**D5 — induction licenses.** The two mechanical licenses the
playground validated: (i) the compiler-arc license — a stuck
recursive call whose subject is a wholly symbolic value produced by
case-splitting a goal binder, at split depth ≥ 1, rewrites by the
goal equation; (ii) the catalog license — the subject may be a
partially decided slot SHAPE at slot depth ≥ 1 (strong induction;
depth 0 excluded so the goal cannot cite itself). Both are search
heuristics only — the rendered proof faces the kernel's own induction
forms, and G4 is the judge.

**D6 — engine sequencing.** S4b is IN SCOPE — it is the engine
behind every fast playground settlement — and sequenced late only
because the earlier rungs are its parts bin. There is no performance
gate on it: constant factors do not decide tractability in this
domain (D7), so the only open question about S4b is build order.

**D7 — performance posture (USER RULING 2026-07-11).** The in-shard
version is the durable one: shard is not considered successful until
the C/Rust gap is entirely closed, and this arc builds on that
trajectory rather than hedging against it. The measured domain
structure backs it — demos settle in under a second or not at all;
tractability is decided by the quotient/oracle match, not evaluator
throughput. Consequence: **no scoping decision in this arc is made
on performance grounds.** When something is actually slow, the order
of attack is engine-level economies first (the evm/meta-invoke
precedent: 10min → 1.5s was machinery, not hosting), then the
lowering arc's native compilation (search as a flagship lib
consumer — the C-class dissolution).

**D8 — census discipline.** Behavior digests via std/sha256 over
rendered battery outputs; two-level fingerprints where the task has
an inner function; batteries as versioned data in tools/search;
counts pinned per G5. Sampling instruments ride rank-addressability +
std/rng under a fixed seed (bit-identical reruns).


## 6. The slice ladder

1. **S1 + S3:** meta/sketch vocabulary, exact counts, rank/unrank,
   fill; ground engine on evm_call_pure; the rev accumulator task
   with its battery; first pins in run_corpus.sh. Small, proves the
   plumbing end to end.
2. **S2:** dialect grammar builders over the real C-rules; G1 + G2
   gates at d1–d2. The duality demonstrated on the real ledger.
3. **S7-lite:** enumerate + battery-bucket a rung of the structural
   list fragment; first spellings-per-behavior numbers against the
   real dialect; G5 pins. (First feedback into CANON.md.)
4. **S4a + S5:** the symbolic evaluator and the laws oracle; append
   theory first; G3.
5. **S6:** proof rendering + kernel replay; G4. Exit criterion: one
   law-certified synthesis (rev against its interface) and one
   certified catalog bracket (the d1 "19 = exactly 13") land as
   corpus-pinned, kernel-checked artifacts.
6. **S4b:** the superposed executor — the choices-map machine over
   the by-now-proven vocabulary; G3 extends to three-way agreement;
   hashprune-style pruning follows it, not precedes it.

Each slice lands ratified-scope-first, gates with it, corpus
DIFF-clean, per house discipline. Graduation into meta/ happens at
slice boundaries when a bucket is clean (D2), not on a schedule.


## 7. Non-goals, stated once

No UI. No second evaluator to keep honest (the
ground path IS kernel/evm). No unproven rewrite ever enters a neutral
join. No engine verdict is ever cited without its G4 certificate. And
no obligation, ever, to keep up with the playground — it explores,
this version consolidates.


## 8. The arc record (slice ledger)

### Slice 1 — meta/sketch + the ground engine (LANDED 2026-07-11)

**What landed.**

- **meta/sketch** (day-one meta/ residence per D2): the D1 reserved-head
  hole encoding with its loud three-way classifier (HVHole / HVNot /
  HVBad — a hole-headed call with any other argument shape is refused,
  never skipped; the reserved head is the qname of the `hole` builder
  itself), hole collection with sharing-dedup, closedness, verbatim
  fill (single pass, no binder shifting — the fill contract is stated
  in the header), and the grammar layer: per-hole alternative tables
  (GEnt/Grammar) under THE STRATIFICATION LAW — entry ids strictly
  ascending, an alternative's holes strictly greater than its entry's
  id, one owner per hole. The law is what makes every pass total by
  plain structural folds: counting = one reverse fold (memo), deciding
  = one forward fold (live digits), closing = one reverse fold — no
  fuel, no cycle detection, no mutual SCC beyond the standard
  Expr/list/arms walkers. Exact bignum counts; rank-addressed unrank
  under the documented ADDRESSING LAW (distinct holes ascending, last
  = least-significant digit; alternatives = consecutive intervals in
  list order).
- **examples/sketch_pin.shard** — 14 kernel-computed claims: counts,
  unrank at interval edges, sharing-is-one-decision (root sharing and
  in-alternative sharing both pinned), the verbatim-fill contract, and
  the refusal family (stratification violation at wf AND at count,
  cross-entry ownership, malformed hole, out-of-range index).
- **tools/search** (the D2 clone): the ground engine — unrank → FnDef
  → inject into the loaded object module's fn list → battery through
  meta/invoke's invoke_fd (evm_call_pure; D3 honored, no
  engine-private evaluator) with early exit across tests. Injection
  rides the fact that evm_call_pure rebuilds its dispatch tables from
  the Module's fn LIST (the stale FnTrie field is never consulted on
  that path). A stuck / type-wrong candidate (the untyped-grammar
  regime) fails its test through the whole-or-nothing value decode —
  probed explicitly before the engine was built on it.
- **The rev task**, replicating the playground's measurement record
  against the real kernel: base hole leaf-only {acc, Nil, xs} at every
  depth, step hole {acc, h, t, Nil} + Cons/append over fresh
  depth-(d-1) sub-holes (grammar extracted from the playground source,
  read as data). Space 3·S(d), S(0)=4, S(d)=4+2·S(d-1)²: **COUNT 108 /
  SOLUTIONS 1 at d1 (0.6s), COUNT 7788 / SOLUTIONS 13 at d2 (15s)** —
  the published counts and solution-set sizes, exactly. d1's single
  solution index 8 hand-decodes to the textbook `(Cons h acc)`.

**Gates.** The 14 pin claims replay under bin/shard_check (kernel-
computed, G5's claim-layer half); the tool's COUNT/SOL/SOLUTIONS lines
are corpus-pinned in run_corpus.sh (the diff-tool half — an addressing
or grammar change moves them and fails the FAIL-set/output diff);
three new corpus targets (sketch_pin, rev_obj, search) check green;
corpus FAIL-set diff clean against fails-base.txt.

**Gotchas recorded.**

- Int-measured recursion (`(measure d)` / countdown loops) needs
  solver-generated descent sidecars: `bin/shard_eval run
  tools/prove/prove.shard FILE` writes the .auto.shard; struct
  measures need nothing.
- shardfmt is a stdout filter and REFORMATS multi-line ctor spines;
  format before hand-diffing anything.
- evm_call_pure rebuilds ixt/efftab/fntab per invocation. At d2 that
  is 4×7,788 rebuilds ≈ 15s wall — fine for the pin, and the obvious
  first engine economy when a rung is actually slow (D7's
  order-of-attack): a staged pure-invocation surface on meta/invoke
  ("prepare a module once, invoke many"). Not built; noted.

**Implementation-discovered decision points (user attention wanted).**

- **D9 (open) — rank, the inverse.** S1 says "rank/unrank"; slice 1
  ships count + unrank. candidate→index needs an alternative-matching
  discipline (top-level structural non-overlap of alternatives) to be
  well-defined; no consumer needs it yet. Proposal: defer to the
  slice that consumes it (dedup/citation), with the non-overlap check
  added to g_wf at that point.
- **D10 (open) — cross-entry hole sharing.** The correlation primitive
  is licensed at the sketch root and within an alternative (both
  pinned); a hole reachable from two DIFFERENT entries is refused
  (g_wf + a live-merge guard), because it breaks sum-of-products
  counting. The playground's skeleton-level sharing maps to root
  sharing, so nothing measured is lost at this rung; S4b's choices
  map will want the general form and should bring its own counting
  story when it arrives.
- **D11 (open) — solution rendering.** SOL pin lines carry candidate
  INDICES (deterministic under the addressing law), not source text.
  Rendering an arbitrary synthesized Expr (Match/Ctor/BVar) as source
  is exactly the S6-adjacent renderer meta/spell's canonical-expr
  subset does not cover; it should land once, with proof rendering,
  not as a one-off printer here.
