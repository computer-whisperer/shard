shard program search — SEARCH.md
=================================

STATUS: DRAFT (proposed 2026-07-11) — nothing below is ratified. This
is the scope ledger for the meta-search arc: a lasting, in-repo
replication of the search playground's basic behaviors, built under
meta/ against the real kernel, the real canonical dialect, and the
real proof machinery. Decision points are marked D1–D8 and each needs
a ruling before code assumes an answer.

The evidence base is ~/workspace/playground/shard_search_playground
(read as data, never touched). Its README is the measurement record:
needed narrowing over shard terms, lemma-quotiented grammars,
law-directed verdicts, the canonical-program catalog, and the mined
canon rules that CANON.md §13 turned into C11/C12. Numbers cited
below are from that README.


## 1. Why a lasting version: coupling, not scale

The playground proved five things (its "Lessons for shard" section):
superposition is an executor strategy, sketches are meta-layer work,
the generator/recognizer duality earns its keep, canonicalization is
the whole cost of search, and the memo is the whole game. It proved
them at scales the in-repo version should NOT chase — 10^36-candidate
settlements are Rust-with-mutable-arenas numbers, and the playground
remains the right lab for them.

What the playground structurally CANNOT do is couple. It re-implements
an approximation of the dialect (its own canon flags), remaps
requirements by hand, deliberately stopped short of the proof finish
line ("rendering each Proven region's trace as a shard proof term …
deliberately not built yet"), and its counts ride machine words that
overflow. Every one of those gaps is a thing this repo already owns:

- **The real dialect.** kernel/canon.shard's recognizers (C1–C11) and
  tools/canon's fixpoint are the ground truth the playground's
  `canon`/`dialect` flags approximate. A generated candidate can be
  GATED canonical — generate, then assert `cn_e` returns Nil — instead
  of hoped canonical.
- **The real requirements.** mod.req.shard surfaces parse natively;
  the laws oracle needs no remapping hacks.
- **The real proof machinery.** tools/prove's sidecar format, merge
  discipline, and bin/shard_check replay exist. The playground's
  missing finish line — Proven verdicts becoming zero-trust
  certificates — is REACHABLE here, and it is the single biggest
  reason to build in-repo at all.
- **Exact counting.** Int is bignum; the playground's u64→u128→panic
  ladder dissolves. Counts are exact at any rung, with no guard code.
- **The census flywheel.** The README's closing cycle — census →
  classify residue → name the rule and license → implement at the
  priced tier → re-measure with behaviors preserved — is the loop
  that produced C11. Running it against the REAL dialect, with
  kernel-certified equivalence brackets, is CANON.md's measurement
  instrument from §13 onward.

So the arc's identity: **exactness + kernel coupling + the proof
finish line, at honest depths; scale stays in the playground.**


## 2. What the repo already owns (the mapping)

| playground piece | in-repo owner |
|---|---|
| eval.rs (ground CBV evaluator) | kernel/evm.shard via meta/invoke's `evm_call_pure` — already the plan-step engine |
| canon flags / dialect grammar | kernel/canon.shard recognizers + tools/canon fixpoint (the ground truth) |
| four append lemmas, lia normalizer, ring rules | std/list, std/arith, kernel/facts — proven, typed, citable |
| law parsing (mod.req remap) | the module system's own req surfaces |
| proof finish line (absent) | tools/prove sidecars + bin/shard_check replay |
| u64/u128 counting | native bignum Int |
| SplitMix64 sampling | std/rng (or a sibling PRNG added under the same discipline) |
| recognizer side of the duality | meta/shape precedent (recognizers as a meta library; §6ae line) |
| behavior fingerprints (128-bit digests) | std/sha256 (hx_digest precedent) |

The pieces with NO in-repo owner — the sketch vocabulary, the
generators, the engines, the symbolic evaluator — are the arc.


## 3. The subsystem ledger

Each subsystem gets: what it buys, what it costs to maintain
(coupling), and a proposed verdict.

**S1. meta/sketch — the term-with-holes vocabulary.**
Sketch representation, per-hole grammar tables (alternative lists),
exact candidate counting, rank/unrank (the space is rank-addressable,
so sampling and slicing are free), fill/render, hole sharing (one
HoleId at two positions = same subtree, the correlation primitive).
*Buys:* the foundation every other subsystem consumes; lesson 2
verbatim ("a meta/ sketch vocabulary … is all shard needs").
*Costs:* pure data + arithmetic; near-zero coupling.
*Verdict:* **BUILD, first.**

**S2. Dialect grammar builders — the generator side of the duality.**
Grammar constructors that speak the canonical dialect as generation
constraints: C4 arm order, C5 exhaustiveness/no-dead-arms, decided
control excluded (C2/C11's generator image = the pinned normal form),
theory quotients where the lemma set is proven (append operand
constraints; ring spines later). Gated, not trusted: G1/G2 below.
*Buys:* lesson 3 — every recognizer run backwards; searchable spaces
at all; the measurement instrument that prices every future C-rule
(each new rule's generation-side payoff becomes a number).
*Costs:* the REAL maintenance item of the arc — a third speaker of
the canon rules (kernel recognizer, tools/canon fixer, generator).
Drift between speakers is the failure mode; the census gates are the
alarm. This coupling is also the point: it is CANON.md's flywheel.
*Verdict:* **BUILD**, with the gates as a non-negotiable part of the
subsystem, not an afterthought.

**S3. Ground engine — enumerate/unrank + evaluate.**
Candidates run against I/O batteries through the real evaluator
(evm_call_pure on the filled, closed term). Early-exit across tests,
absence proofs by exhaustion at small depth, the cross-check for
everything cleverer.
*Buys:* the baseline oracle; exactness for free; tiny.
*Costs:* near-zero (rides kernel/evm).
*Verdict:* **BUILD, first** (with S1).

**S4a. Symbolic evaluator — per-candidate three-valued verdicts.**
Symbolic values for ∀-binders, case splits allocating one shape per
ctor (symbolic ADTs over the type table), canonical neutrals (fn- and
prim-headed; join by same-head-equal-args congruence), verdicts
Proven / Refuted / Undecided with a split budget, and the two IH
licenses (D5). NOTE the decomposition this ledger makes that the
playground did not: the playground built its laws mode ON the
superposed candidate engine, but per-candidate symbolic evaluation
does not need candidate superposition — one term, one goal, case-split
regions only. That is a far smaller machine, and it is the one the
catalog and the proof finish line actually need.
*Buys:* the laws oracle (S5), catalog refinement (S7), and the input
to proof rendering (S6). One symbolic case refutes what ground
testing kills one value at a time.
*Costs:* the largest NEW engineering item that is not deferrable; no
existing shard code does this. Kinship with tools/prove is real (the
same case-split + steps + refl shape; its unhinted case-on discovery
already scans stuck frontiers) — shared machinery graduates to meta/
only when both speak it, per the hygiene-pass ruling; do not force
premature unification.
*Verdict:* **BUILD**, as its own slice, after S1–S3 prove the
plumbing.

**S4b. Superposed candidate executor — needed narrowing proper.**
The choices-map machine: shared thunk graph, consulted-choice-set
memo, fork on demanded holes, prefix kills, don't-cares. This is
where all the playground's scale leverage lives (1,181× at rev d3;
the only reason 10^15+ spaces settle) — and it is also the most code,
the least kernel coupling, and the piece whose advantage a
shard_eval-hosted evaluator throttles hardest (the memo is mutable-
arena-shaped; pure-functional hash-consing pays real constants).
*Buys:* scale beyond what enumeration reaches — IF the hosting is
fast enough to matter.
*Costs:* high build, high maintenance, performance-critical.
*Verdict:* **DEFER (D6)** — go/no-go after S1–S7 land, on measured
evidence: a concrete task the shipped subsystems cannot settle, plus
a measured throughput estimate. The long-run answer may instead be
compiling meta/search natively via the lib pipeline (D7).

**S5. Laws oracle — requirements as the search oracle.**
Parse a requirement, bind its ∀-binders symbolically, remap the
subject fn to the sketch, compare goal sides under S4a. Rule sets for
canonical neutrals drawn ONLY from proven, typed equations (D4).
*Buys:* proofs instead of tests; the impostor problem (six
under-constraining examples "solving" sort) dissolves at the root.
*Costs:* thin over S4a + the module system.
*Verdict:* **BUILD** (same slice family as S4a).

**S6. Proof rendering — the finish line.**
A Proven verdict's trace becomes shard proof text: case-on/induct,
steps of unfold / rewrite-lemma / refl, IH citations — emitted as a
generated .shard program (the synthesized fns + claims/fulfills) with
its .auto.shard sidecar, replayed through bin/shard_check. A Proven
that fails replay is a HARD failure (G4). The search's verdicts
become zero-trust certificates; the engines stay outside the trust
surface entirely, like the compiled chain.
*Buys:* the thing the playground deliberately lacks; the arc's
unique payoff. Search output = a shard program the kernel has
checked, not a claim about one.
*Costs:* moderate; rides tools/prove's sidecar format and the proof
DSL. The render layer is coupled to proof-form syntax (stable, and
already machine-written by tools/prove daily).
*Verdict:* **BUILD** — and treat it as the arc's exit criterion, not
an optional extra.

**S7. Catalog / census — the CANON.md flywheel.**
Enumerate a canonical rung, battery-bucket by behavior digest
(std/sha256 over rendered output vectors; two-level fingerprinting
per the census lesson — silence is not success), refine the bracket
with S4a equivalence proofs (floor rises on refuted pairs, ceiling
falls on proven ones), and — with S6 — CERTIFY the bracket at small
rungs the way the playground certified d1 (19 programs = exactly 13
functions). Sampling instruments (rank-addressable + std/rng) later.
*Buys:* the census loop that mined C11/C12, now running against the
real dialect with kernel-checked equivalences; spellings-per-behavior
against the REAL rule ledger is the metric CANON.md optimizes.
*Costs:* thin composition of S1/S2/S3/S4a; battery data is data.
*Verdict:* **BUILD** (enumerate+bucket early; refinement after S4a).

**S8. Tasks and batteries.**
The concrete sketches (rev, sort's insert, the calculator, …), their
I/O batteries, their requirement oracles. Data plus thin drivers in
the tool bin. The oracle lessons travel with them: batteries need the
input shapes that separate impostors ([2,1,3] for insert; deep-push-
then-add for the VM), and every task should state whether its oracle
is tests (floor only) or laws (certifiable).
*Verdict:* **BUILD** (small; grows by accretion).

**S9. Gates.**
- **G1 canonicality:** every generated candidate at pinned small
  depths passes kernel `cn_e` = Nil and is a tools/canon fixpoint.
  The three-speakers drift alarm.
- **G2 quotient exactness:** at d1–d2, the dialect grammar's candidate
  set equals the raw grammar's normal forms, censused term-by-term
  (the --canon-verify discipline); behaviors preserved within the
  one-rung depth price (the raw twin's measured law).
- **G3 cross-engine agreement:** law-Proven ⊆ ground-test passers; no
  passer Refuted; ground and symbolic partitions consistent wherever
  both run.
- **G4 kernel replay:** every Proven renders and replays green
  through bin/shard_check. Non-negotiable.
- **G5 pinned counts:** canonical-program counts and behavior-bucket
  counts at fixed rungs pinned in run_corpus.sh (the census-gate
  discipline). A canon-rule change moves them; intentional moves
  re-pin with the change, like tools/canon's census today.
*Verdict:* **BUILD**, incrementally with their subsystems.

**Explicitly OUT (not built, not maintained):**
the OE engine (the literature control lost the races; its lesson is
recorded), the damascene race UI, the vanity/IC comparison, wedge
parallelism (until a native-compiled engine exists to parallelize),
hashprune/opportunistic pruning (meaningful only on S4b's fork tree),
u128 counter machinery (bignum), and playground parity as a goal —
the playground keeps modes this version never grows.


## 4. Placement and tier

- **meta/sketch** — S1. Pure vocabulary, meta-stdlib resident (the
  meta/shape precedent: consumable by any program that manipulates
  shard source).
- **meta/search** — S2 + S3 + S4a + S5 (+ S4b if ever ruled in), a
  directory module. Engines and grammar builders as a library.
- **tools/search** — the thin bin: tasks, batteries, census drivers,
  CLI, the corpus-gate entry points. Consumes meta/search the way
  shardfmt consumes meta/format.
- Proof rendering (S6) starts life in meta/search's render layer;
  anything tools/prove later also speaks graduates per the
  hygiene-pass ruling.

Trust posture, stated once: **the engines are never the soundness
authority.** Ground/symbolic agreement is a gate; the kernel replay
of rendered proofs is the only certificate; everything else is a
differentially-gated accelerator, exactly the compiled-chain regime.


## 5. Decision points

**D1 — hole representation.** (a) RECOMMENDED: a reserved-head
encoding inside kernel Expr — `(Call (:: meta sketch hole) (IntLit k))`
— so every existing Expr walker, recognizer, and renderer works on
partial terms unchanged, with loud classifier helpers in meta/sketch;
the kernel never checks a sketch (holes are filled before any check).
(b) A parallel SketchExpr type mirroring Expr + Hole — cleaner
separation, but duplicates every walker and cuts sketches off from
the real recognizers. (c) Holes as reserved FVars — viable, but a
numbered-hole id rides better as an IntLit argument.

**D2 — placement and trust tier** as §4. Ratifying this fixes where
code lives and that no engine output is ever load-bearing without G4.

**D3 — evaluation substrate.** Ground evaluation via kernel/evm
(`evm_call_pure`, the meta/invoke precedent) — single hosted
interpretation, no engine-private evaluator to keep in agreement.
The symbolic evaluator (S4a) is necessarily new code; it shares the
term vocabulary but not the machine.

**D4 — oracle rule sets.** Canonical-neutral rewrites are drawn ONLY
from proven requirements, carrying their binder types as side
conditions (the append_nil_right lesson, learned three separate
times: an escaping operand needs its type known; spine-rebuilding
rewrites are fail-consistent). First cut: the append four + the lia
normalizer under std/arith's stated license. Ring rules (CANON.md
D9's predicted set) when a task demands them. Three certificate
categories, all kernel-replayable: definitional, lemma-cited,
decision-procedure-backed.

**D5 — induction licenses.** The two mechanical licenses the
playground validated: (i) the compiler-arc license — a stuck
recursive call whose subject is a wholly symbolic value produced by
case-splitting a goal binder, at split depth ≥ 1, rewrites by the
goal equation; (ii) the catalog license — the subject may be a
partially decided slot SHAPE at slot depth ≥ 1 (strong induction;
depth 0 excluded so the goal cannot cite itself). Both are search
heuristics only — the rendered proof faces the kernel's own induction
forms, and G4 is the judge.

**D6 — the superposed executor (S4b).** DEFERRED. Go/no-go revisited
only with: (a) a named task the shipped subsystems cannot settle at a
depth that matters, and (b) a measured throughput estimate of the
hosted engine on that task. Until then, enumeration + symbolic
verdicts at honest depths.

**D7 — the performance path.** Rung 1: shard_eval-hosted, correctness
first, depths that finish. Rung 2: engine-level economies (the
evm/meta-invoke precedent: 10min → 1.5s was won by machinery, not
hosting). Rung 3 — the C-class answer: meta/search compiled natively
via the lib pipeline, making search a flagship lowering consumer; the
playground's Rust-speed advantage is not permanent, it is exactly the
gap the lowering arc exists to close. The playground stays the scale
lab meanwhile, and parity is explicitly not maintained.

**D8 — census discipline.** Behavior digests via std/sha256 over
rendered battery outputs; two-level fingerprints where the task has
an inner function; batteries as versioned data in tools/search;
counts pinned per G5. Sampling instruments ride rank-addressability +
std/rng under a fixed seed (bit-identical reruns).


## 6. The slice ladder

1. **S1 + S3:** meta/sketch vocabulary, exact counts, rank/unrank,
   fill; ground engine on evm_call_pure; the rev accumulator task
   with its battery; first pins in run_corpus.sh. Small, proves the
   plumbing end to end.
2. **S2:** dialect grammar builders over the real C-rules; G1 + G2
   gates at d1–d2. The duality demonstrated on the real ledger.
3. **S7-lite:** enumerate + battery-bucket a rung of the structural
   list fragment; first spellings-per-behavior numbers against the
   real dialect; G5 pins. (First feedback into CANON.md.)
4. **S4a + S5:** the symbolic evaluator and the laws oracle; append
   theory first; G3.
5. **S6:** proof rendering + kernel replay; G4. Exit criterion: one
   law-certified synthesis (rev against its interface) and one
   certified catalog bracket (the d1 "19 = exactly 13") land as
   corpus-pinned, kernel-checked artifacts.
6. **(gated by D6)** the superposed executor, if the evidence ever
   says so.

Each slice lands ratified-scope-first, gates with it, corpus
DIFF-clean, per house discipline.


## 7. Non-goals, stated once

No UI. No scale headlines. No second evaluator to keep honest (the
ground path IS kernel/evm). No unproven rewrite ever enters a neutral
join. No engine verdict is ever cited without its G4 certificate. And
no obligation, ever, to keep up with the playground — it explores,
this version consolidates.
